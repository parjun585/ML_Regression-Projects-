## Project Motivation
The motivation for this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast food delivery times. This allows delivery services to manage resources efficiently, provide accurate ETAs to customers, and identify potential delays in advance. Key objectives include:
- **Analyzing** factors affecting delivery time.
- **Building** and **evaluating** various regression models to predict delivery time.
- **Improving** the accuracy of predictions using feature engineering and model tuning.

## Project Files
- \`Food_Delivery_Time_Predictions.ipynb\`: Jupyter Notebook containing all steps for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- \`data/\`: Folder containing datasets used for analysis and model training.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/parjun585/ML_Regression-Projects-/tree/main/Food%20Delivery%20Time%20predictions
   cd Food\ Delivery\ Time\ predictions
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
  ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Description
The dataset includes various features that may impact delivery time, such as:
- **Order Details**: Information about the order items and their preparation times.
- **Distance**: The distance between the restaurant and the delivery location.
- **Traffic Conditions**: Factors such as time of day, weekday, or traffic patterns that may influence delivery duration.
- **Weather Conditions**: Any relevant weather data that could affect delivery times.

## Modeling Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to identify patterns and relationships among variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features such as delivery distance and time-based features to improve model accuracy.
4. **Model Selection and Training**: Train multiple regression models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to select the best model.

## Results
The final model achieved high accuracy in predicting delivery times, with performance metrics as follows:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: (insert MAE here)
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: (insert RMSE here)
These results demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in providing reliable delivery time estimates.

## How to Use
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook (\`Food_Delivery_Time_Predictions.ipynb\`) to reproduce the analysis.
2. Adjust parameters and experiment with different models and features for further customization.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional external data, such as real-time traffic and weather information, for even more accurate predictions.
- Explore advanced modeling techniques such as neural networks and ensemble methods.
- Develop a deployment strategy to integrate the prediction model into a live system for real-time delivery estimates.
